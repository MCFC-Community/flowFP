CHANGES IN VERSION 1.47.0
-------------------------

* The update to R4.0.2 caused warnings like:
```
    Warning messages:
    1: In .Call("bin_level", fcs@exprs, model@.tmp_tags, model@split_axis[[level]],  :
      converting NULL pointer to R NULL.
```
  The c code was updated to avoid returning a null pointer.

* Updated citation syntax was incorporated in the CITATION file.



CHANGES IN VERSION 1.10.0
-------------------------

* We now require that length of sampleClasses be the same as the number of
instances in the flowFP object.  The documentation indicated that, but
the code didn't enforce it.

* Fixed a bug regarding setting sampleClasses for a flowFPPlex.  It erroneously assigned classes to only the first member of the plex.

* Setting sampleClasses for a fp or a pled to NULL or to a zero-length factor now results in removing sampleClasses from the fp or plex.

* Cleaned up documentation for flowFP-class and flowFPPlex-class.
